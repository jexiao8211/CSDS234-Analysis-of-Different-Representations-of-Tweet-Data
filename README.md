# Analysis-of-Different-Representations-of-Tweet-Data
CSDS 234 Final Project: Jerry Xiao, Quoc Trung Nguyen, Akansh Devandra

Analyzing query time and space complexity of different vectorized representations of twitter data.  
<br></br>


**Vectorized Represntations:**

CountVect: Basic keyword extraction

TF-IDF: Measures frequenct and relevance of keywords

Brown Clustering: clustering words with similar meaning  
<br></br>

**Querying:**

Select tweets containing user-passed keywords  
<br></br>


**Experimentation:**
1) Test query runtimes of each representation with different query size
2) Test relationship between number of tweets in dataset and size of data representation
3) Test relationship between number of tweets in dataset and query time
